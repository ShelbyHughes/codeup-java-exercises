The insert statement
The insert statement inserts data into the databases

Basic format
INSERT INTO table_name (field1, field2, ...)
VALUES ('value1', 'value2', ...);

Example
INSERT INTO quotes (author_first_name, author_last_name, content)
VALUES ('Douglas', 'Adams', 'I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.');

INSERT INTO quotes (author_first_name, author_last_name, content)
VALUES ('Douglas', 'Adams',    'Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.'),
       ('Mark',    'Twain',    'Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.'),
       ('Kurt',    'Vonnegut', 'The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest.');

The Select Statement

We use Select to find and return rows from a table

Basic format
Select column1, column2, ....
