4 pillars of OOP
1. Abstract
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of exposing essential details and hiding (ignoring) unnecessary details to reduce complexity for the user

Encapsulation: Bundling data and operations (Properties and methods) together into a cohesive entity.
Classes
Instance

Inheritance: deriving a new type (class) from an existing type.
Extends classes
Overriding
super

Polymorphism: Allows an entity to take on different meanings in different contexts.
